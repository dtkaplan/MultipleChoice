Here is a display constructed using the Current Population Survey wage data:

```{r echo = FALSE}
gf_boxplot(wage ~ sector + color:sex, data = CPS85)
```

Read the graphic to determine which variable is playing which role: x-axis, y-axis, color, etc. Then reconstruct the command to reproduce the graph.

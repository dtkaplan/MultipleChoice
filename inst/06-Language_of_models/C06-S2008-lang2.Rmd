Using your general knowledge about the world, think about the
relationship between these variables:

#. `speed` of a bicyclist.
#. `steepness` of the road, a quantitative variable 
measured by the grade (rise over run). 0 means flat, + means uphill, $-$ means downhill.
#. `fitness` of the rider, a categorical variable with three
levels: unfit, average, athletic.


On a piece of paper, sketch out a graph of speed versus steepness for reasonable models of each of these forms:

* Model 1: `speed` ~ 1 + `steepness`

```{asis}
ANSWER: Imagine that positive steepness means uphill, and negative steepness
is downhill. 
As the hill gets steeper uphill, bicycle speed gets slower.  So this
model would be a line that slopes negatively.
```

* Model 2: `speed` ~ 1 + `fitness`

```{asis}
ANSWER: Increased fitness leads to higher speed, so the line of speed against fittness will slope upwards.
```

* Model 3: `speed` ~ 1 + `steepness`+`fitness`

```{asis}
ANSWER: Speed will go down with greater steepness (uphill) and speed will go
up with greater fitness.
```

* Model 4: `speed` ~ 1 + `steepness`+`fitness` + `steepness`:`fitness``

```{asis} 
ANSWER: Compared to Model 3, what's new here is the interaction term between
steepness and fitness.  Presumably, more fit people don't slow down as
much when they encounter a hill, so the interaction should reduce the
effect of steepness.

```{r echo = FALSE}
if ( ! exists(".show_answers")) .show_answers <- TRUE
```

Using your general knowledge about the world, think about the
relationship between these variables:

```{marginfigure echo = .show_answers}
MODEL 1 ANSWER: Imagine that positive steepness means uphill, and negative steepness is downhill. As the hill gets steeper uphill, bicycle speed gets slower.  So this model would be a line that slopes negatively.

MODEL 2 ANSWER: Increased fitness leads to higher speed, so the line of speed against fittness will slope upwards.

MODEL 3 ANSWER: Speed will go down with greater steepness (uphill) and speed will go
up with greater fitness.

MODEL 4 ANSWER: Compared to Model 3, what's new here is the interaction term between
steepness and fitness.  Presumably, more fit people don't slow down as
much when they encounter a hill, so the interaction should reduce the
effect of steepness.

#. `speed` of a bicyclist.
#. `steepness` of the road, a quantitative variable  measured by the grade (rise over run). 0 means flat, + means uphill, $-$ means downhill.
#. `fitness` of the rider, a categorical variable with three levels: `"unfit"`, `"average"`, `"athletic"`.


On a piece of paper, sketch out a graph of speed versus steepness for reasonable models of each of these forms:

* Model 1: `speed` ~ 1 + `steepness`
* Model 2: `speed` ~ 1 + `fitness`
* Model 3: `speed` ~ 1 + `steepness`+`fitness`
* Model 4: `speed` ~ 1 + `steepness`+`fitness` + `steepness`:`fitness``

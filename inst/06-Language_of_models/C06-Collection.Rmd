# Multiple Choice

## Problem 1

```{r child = "C06-S2008-101.Rmd"} 
```

## Problem 2

```{r child = "C06-M102.Rmd"}
```

## Problem 3

```{r child = "C06-M105.Rmd"}
```








# Computational Technique

- `C06-graphing-models.Rmd` --- need to move to datacamp
- Problem idea: Show graphs of fitted models. Ask the student to make them. e.g. the swim-records data
- `C06-S2008-var1.Rmd` --- moved (in part) to the Motivating Statistics datacamp repository
- `C06-language101.Rmd` --- moved to Motivating Statistics

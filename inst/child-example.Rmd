```{r include = FALSE}
library(MultipleChoice)
Scorekeeper <<- list(problem=NULL, attempts=NULL, score=NULL)
```

## Exercise 2

When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one ...
```{r echo = FALSE}
MC_question("declaration2", "people" = "**RIGHT**", "government" = "**WRONG**")
callModule(MC, "declaration2", "declaration2",
           hints = TRUE)
```


Note the use of the `height` parameter to determine how much vertical space the embedded application should occupy.

You can also use the `shinyApp` function to define an application inline rather then in an external directory.

In all of R code chunks above the `echo = FALSE` attribute is used. This is to prevent the R code within the chunk from rendering in the document alongside the Shiny components.
